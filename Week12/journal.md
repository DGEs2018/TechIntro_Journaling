* Setting up sass
- to run the server everytime change is made to both `package.json` & the `.scss` files `npm run sass | npm run dev` needs to run in the root terminal
- sass watch can be set to constantly note changes and reload the server automatically - this is done within the "scripts" section in the `package.json` file `"sass --watch pages/Landing/landing.scss:pages/Landing/landing.css"`. After the `sass --watch` `input path : output path` follows.
