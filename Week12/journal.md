* Setting up sass
- to run the server everytime change is made to both `package.json` & the `.scss` files `npm run sass | npm run dev` needs to run in the root terminal
- sass watch can be set to constantly note changes and reload the server automatically - this is done within the "scripts" section in the `package.json` file `"sass --watch pages/Landing/landing.scss:pages/Landing/landing.css"`. After the `sass --watch` `input path : output path` follows.
- CSS
    - <img></img> is NOT to be confused with background image. One doesn't necessarily need the img element in html to insert a background image.
    - Unmatching path of an image could find `Refused to apply style from...is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.`
    - viewport units
        - em, rem, vh, vw
        - vw - viewport width in percentage (1vw - 1% of viewport width)
        - vh - viewport height in percentage (1vh - 1% of viewport height)
        - pixels - used to be very commonly especially before responsive designs were introduced
            - disadvantage -  unit isn't scalable. Meaning pixel size is fixed and doesn't change according as viewport size varies
        - so then em, rem, percent and viewport units were introduced

    - CSS sourcemaps are the bridge between the browser and pre-processor such as Sass, so that the browser understands
        - Sass mixin
        - placeholder
        - variable
    - combining sourcemaps with console window of browsers(real-time mock reloading), speeds up editing workflow
    - CSS sourcemaps enable the browser to track Sass functionalities CSS generated by a

* CSS
- Contents under HTML elements are like layers of onions. Inside out they are denoted below sequencially
    - element - the text itself
    - padding - which sits between the padding and the margin
    - border - sits between padding and margin
    - margin - occupies the outermost above the border

* Building layout
- Having an overview of the layout of a given a design could help roughly simplify before tackling the details. The list below should help categorize general overview
    - header tag
    - section tag
    - footer tag
    - navigation tag

* Positioning in CSS
    - replacing `position: relative; or position: absolute` and manipulating with `margins & paddings` could be a better to practice to position elements
    - flexbox is another handier method (one dimensional left to right or top to )
        - `property selector id or class {justify-content: flex-start; or flex-end; or center; or space-between; space-around}` left to right 
        - `property selector id or class {align-items: flex-start; or flex-end; or center; or space-between; space-around}` top to bottom
    - css grid layout
* BEM101 (Block, Element, Modifier methodology)
- Why we should follow BEM
    - Easier readability and association of parent-child when producing a new style of a component
    - When only looking at
