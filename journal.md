* Git workflow and creating .gitignore file
- Starting with the pole for all project
    - git-clone repository link
    - add .gitignore file and make the list of files to be ignored (`DS_Store`, `node_modules`)
        - if `vim .gitignore` command is used to open the file, then
         `esc` `:wq` to get off the file, write (save) and quit - equivalent to save and close.
        - easier to use should be `nano .gitignore` command, where the list of commands is mentioned at the bottom of the file
