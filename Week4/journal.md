* How the Internet works (a personal reference I've been using and would strongly recommend - many of the lessons from <https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-apr-computer-science-principles-harvardx-cs50-ap>)
    - IP Adresses
    - TCP / IP
    - DNS
    - DHCP
    - Server : what it is 
    - Web server - a quick glimpse at how to set up one with node.js & Express
  - | Command           | Function                              |
  - |---                |---                                    |
  - |pwd                | print the current working directory   |
 * Installed Preview Markdown Extension `cmd + shift + v` (comes in handy to preview changes made on text editor)
 * Read up concerning the `.gitignore` file and created one at the root folder TRAINEESHIP-PROGRESS 
 * On algorithms and time complexity - from the introduction to CS module
    - Algorithmic thinking when going about to solve problems and its time complexity  
    - Importance of algorithm

* CLI recap 
    - cd alone takes one to the root directory
    - pwd shows the working directory, including the whole path
    Binary system - letters represented in terms of numbers
    - The analogy of frames per second in movies, screens and computers
    - Multiple layers
      - OS, node - provides you with the enviroment to run and be executed in the OS 
      - Computer programs (such as touch `filename`) 
      - setTimeout(printHello, 2000) is one program given by
      - npm init -y (npm)
      - npm install luxon (need that for libraries building server)
      - lookup for luxon.js for further 
      - library could mean as somebody else's code
      - difference between a browser and node
      
      - Quick recap from the prework session,
      - data types 
         - boolean
         - strings
         - number
         - defined
         - array (could be another one, which could contain / hold)
         .methods
         .reverse, .split, .join - can't for example be directly applied on strings (in JS on array)


         The same code is written for many different types of browsers cross-browsers
         - difference between framework / blurry boundary between (has a mental model to work with, nextjs) and library - a library should be easy to be usable in any framework
         - NextJs - could differently execute both in both client and server-sided
         - Which browsers

         Time-complexity, n square algorithm should be avoided for the reason of time

         - The Internet
         - URL & DNS
         - The router and server link - cable to the closest router
         - With the help of intermediary router, connection is secured
