- More notes on Git
    - the content of whatsoever is written inside readme.md is automatically displayed on Github (unlike other .md files that show their content when clicked)
    - the  problem of using `git revert <last commit>` especially when working in a team
        - as git is technically replacing the older commit with a new one
        - and while doing so it gives a unique identifier id for every new commit, the newly assigned (id) 
        could confuse other collaborators on the project
