* Eloquent JS Chapter 2 - Program Structure ctd.
- Unexpected syntax error will pop up in case of trying to define a reserved word.
- The environment
    - The collection of the bindings and their values that exist at a given time
    - When a program starts up, the enviroment already contains bindings that are part of the language 
    - Also has bindings to interact with the surrounding system
    - For example, there are functions to interact with the currently loaded website & to read mouse and keyboard input
    - Functions
        - A lot of the values in the default environment have the type function
        - Examples - bindings / pop-ups showing small dialogue boxes asking for user input
        - Invoking, calling or applying - are terms for executing functions
        - Values given functions - arguments
        - The number or type of arguments could vary for different functions
        - The console.log functions
            - Most JS systems provide `console.log` functions, which outputs the result after arguments are plugged in the function
            - Javascript console in the browsers can be accessed via `Command option J`
        - Return Values
            - Function produces a value, it's said to return that value
            - Examples: Math.min, Math.max
        - Control flow
            - When program contains multiple statements, they are executed from top to bottom
        - Conditional execution
            - Where programs take a proper branch, based on the conditions
            - This makes use of the `if` keyword
            - The `if` keyword executes or skips a statement depending on the value of a Boolean expression
            - This deciding expression is written between parentheses after the keyword, then followed by the statement to execute
