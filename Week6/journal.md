- SPAs
- What they are ?
    - Are special kind of websites where the user doesn't see any reload despite interacting with the page.
    - SPA relies primarily on JS - interaction with server to change the content in the page.
    - Usually heavy on the first load as this requires the browser to download the entire content.
    - Problems with SEO and SPAs
        - Not very suitable in terms of search engine optimization.
        - HTML sent by the server is by default an empty `<div>` and content is loaded afterwards with JS
        - In case that the crawler can't execute JS - then the reload won't be seen
        - Rendering
        - Multipage applications - as using either server-side or runtime rendering.
        - Client-side rendering
            - Happens in the client - meaning that the client needs to execute JS
            - Hence takes longer to see the content in the page.
            - By default, this makes use of framework such as React or VueJS.
        - Server-side rendering
            - All begins with the client sending a request to a server.
            - In the old way - server can then either respond either with an empty HTML or create HTML before sending it
            - SSR - html is populated in the server & then sent to the client. Then this will be executed at the client side - the plus this time, it now only needs to synchronize with the html instead of having to render the entire page.
    - Include certain files and directories to the .gitignore list
     1. vim .gitignore 
     2. git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

- Multi page App
    - Any small action on the web page triggers a complete refresh of the entire page
    - HTML and Content the same files
    - Everything is happening from the server-side
    - Preferable where static HTML content prevail (blog page)
- SPAs
    - Go to page, you find empty HTML in content
    - By single page, it isn't to mean that it's literally single, the page just doesn't refresh
    - Static (files)
    - Content is what needs a DB (isn't hence static content)
    - Different servers
    - The content is then decoupled from the UI
    - So fast that user never sees an empty HTML
    - User just requests more content
        - Problems
            - Some browsers might not be JS indexed / search engine problems
            - Slow / poor connection might affect the content displayed
    - Contains always static files
    - Client can't differentiate whether rendering was client-side or server-side !!! (given good internet connection)
        - Client-side rendering
            - Happens at the client-side (at the browser and/or crawler)
            - Empty <div></div> would then be populated with the content (the JS will do this after fetching content from the )
            - 
        - Server-side rendering
                - Contains a mix of 
                - On the first request (rendering is the same as that of in multipage apps )
     - If client have more interactions SPAs might be more prefered
- Node JS
    - Contains all sort of files altogether as opposed the old way 
- Building multipage application using ReactJS
    - HTML files already pre-existed
    - 
- Dynamic vs Static pages
    - Dynamic - every time request is sent, it's created on the fly
    - Static - doesn't have to be created  (One does with just a dummy page)

- Git
    - A way of tracking several versions of changes to a documentation.
    - Working directory, staging and commit stages
    - Repository (repo for short) is a working directory on Git (bad practice is to have a repo inside a repo)
    - Master
    - Branches (could have as many as possible)
    - Pull request & code review
    - Some prefer to constantly work on the masters branch
- Environments - the copy of the project that has not yet reached end-users, but rather for developers and managers in the project.
- Development (consist of multiples of sprints)
- Test (checking functionality, UI )
- Staging (different to the stage discussed in Git, tests if newer versions are running without errors with real data, in the same environment as that of the end-users)
- Deployment (the stage when moving from staging to production)
- Production
- SPA + client page application is something like downloading the desktop app everytime you click the application.

- Eloquent Javascript
    - Bits - anything of zeros and ones. Any piece of discrete information can therefore be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones - to be then represented in bits.
    -  right to left with increment of two from right to left Ex. 13 = 8 + 4 + 1, 00001101, 1 - where the summation entity are to a power of two, 0 when not.
    - Values - a typical modern computer contains > (30 billion) 3e10 bits in its working memory.
    - To manage with such quantities of bits - these need to be separated into chunks called values in JS environment.
        - values
            - numbers 
            - pieces of text(string)
            - functions etc.
    - JS uses a fixed number of bits - i.e. 64. With N decimal digits, 10^N numbers : likewise, with 64 binary digits, 2^64 = 18 quintillion(18e18) numbers can be represented. \
    - Fractional numbers, scientific notations 2.998 x 10^8 = 2.998e8
    - Arithmetic : addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, remainder operation ( using the modulo % symbol)
    - Important is the rule of precedence, for operators of same precedence appearing next to one another left to right & in case of doubt binding numbers with parentheses () is ideal. 
    - 3 special numbers in JS
        - infinity
        - -infinity
        - NaN
    - Strings - data type, representing a text, using single & double quotes, or backticks (need to match at the start & end)
    - "This is the first line\nAnd this is the second" \n - means new line, \t, tab
    - Strings can neither be divided, bne multiplied nor subtracted, but could take the `+` operator for concatenation.
    - Operator can also be written as words, such as `typeof` (unary operator) - returning a string value with the type of the given value. Example - console.log(typeof 4.5) --> number
    - Boolean values - distinguishes between true and false
    - Comparison in strings - uppercase letters are always “less” than lowercase ones, so "Z" < "a", and nonalphabetic characters (!, -, and so on) are also included in the ordering
    - The only value in JS that is not equal to itself (NaN- not a number, the third data type) - i.e. console.log(Nan == NaN) --> false
