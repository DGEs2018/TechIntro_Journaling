- SPAs
- What they are ?
    - Are special kind of websites where the user doesn't see any reload despite interacting with the page.
    - SPA relies primarily on JS - interaction with server to change the content in the page.
    - Usually heavy on the first load as this requires the browser to download the entire content.
