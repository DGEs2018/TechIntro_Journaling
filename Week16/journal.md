## DOM Manipulation
- When accessing the child elements of a target parent element. The way directly target the desired target is
 - parentNode or parentElement (the most commonly used one nonetheless parentNode) 
 - Why I got stuck on single functionality for quite a long time
    - clear structuring of the HTML document flow from the start is vital to facilitate 
    - Revising my old JS block of code
        ```javascript
        const accordions = document.getElementsByClassName('js-accordion');
        ```
        ```
        - as more than one accordions are stored in the variable `accordions` for loop comes in handy to iterate through each of those (`forEach` would equally be valid)
        ```
        - we are trying to attach the `.addEventListener` method which on click should return a function named `toggleClass` 
        - called it `toggleClass` in my `.js` file
        - `this.classList.toggle('active')`
        - from here on for the content contained within the accordion, we will define a another `addEventListener`

        - Apply Refactoring (based on the DRY convention)
        -ClassList uses the following functions to change or even just access classes on an element
         - contains, checks whether the element has a class
         - `add` - adds a class to the element
         - `remove` - removes a class
         - `toggle` - adds a class if not present, or removes if it already exists

## Project problem
### Understanding the DOM manipulation
- Recap of what the function toggleClass inside the classes.js (the upcoming-classes page of the frontendtrainee design implementation) is doing
- it takes a parameter (in this case noted as *htmlElement*)
    - this parameter is an array of accordions (above togglingIcons[i])
- the htmlElement.classList is then stored in a variable called 'elementClassList'
- the next sibling for the htmlElement parameter(*htmlElement.classList*) is then defined and saved as *buttonLabel* 
- then follows a conditional statement where the condition is if elementClasslist contains the class (glyphicon-plus) to toggle to 'glyphicon-minus' and vice versa for (glyphicon-minus)

#### Issue
- while we got the button to toggle between the plus and minus signs, the innerText of the buttonLabel won't toggle back after the first click
- after toggled to *minus-icon* on the browser inspector shows that the span holding the glyphicons contains both `glyph.glyphicon-plus.glyphicon-minus`
- 
#### Workaround attempted
- applying `.remove` and `.add` method one after the other
- `.replace(old value, new value)`
- storing the queried containers of specific  after by
#### Solution
- having had the plus-icon selected(*bold* in the code), `const togglingIcons = document.getElementsByClassName('glyphicon *glyphicon-plus*');` the conditional statement wouldn't get past the first conditional statement indicated below
   
    ```javascript
    if (elementClassList.contains('glyphicon-plus')) {
        elementClassList.toggle('glyphicon-minus');
        // console.log(elementClassList.toggle);
        buttonLabel.innerText = 'Less';
    }
    ```
  -Today's latest codes during one-on-one with Jo√£o
 
  ```javascript
    for (let i = 0; i < togglingIcons.length; i += 1) {
        togglingIcons[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
            toggleClass(togglingIcons[i]);
        });
        }
        // the htmlElement is represents each of the togglingIcons, not all of them (not the list)
        function toggleClass(htmlElement) {
        const elementClassList = htmlElement.classList;
        const buttonLabel = htmlElement.nextElementSibling;
        // const accordionParent = htmlElement.parentNode; // is the parent each of the togglingIcons
        if (elementClassList.contains('glyphicon-plus')) {
            elementClassList.toggle('glyphicon-minus');
            buttonLabel.innerText = 'Less';
        } else if (elementClassList.contains('glyphicon-minus')) {
            elementClassList.toggle('glyphicon-plus');
            buttonLabel.innerText = 'Tell me more';
        }
        }
      const togglingIcons = document.getElementsByClassName('glyphicon glyphicon-plus');
    ```

## Issue
  - logically wrongly coded
  - atttaching separate addEventListeners to two elements nested within one another
    - as a consequence when this event is triggered, then two functionalities in different target element would be affected
### Workaround / solution
- Rename the wrapper element firstly 
- Then find every of those target element (using document.getElementsByClassName / document.querySelectorAll or other properties.....)
- As we now have a few of them them, we need to iterate through each of them 
- Out of the many ways to go over an array is `for loop`.
- For each of these let's attach an `addEventListener` which on click should trigger two separate functions defined below
- To tell which function to trigger when clicked, apply the if conditions
#### Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
  - is a function that calls itself (literally invokes itself after being created, without a need to use console.log)
  - comes in handy when you need a function expression instead of the normal function statement
  - as javascript assumes that anything under a parenthesis is an expression, so does it equally assume when the IIFE function is inside. 
  - This is one of the better-practices than having to lie in the global scope ()
      "sass": "sass --watch pages/Aboutus/about-us.scss:pages/Aboutus/about-us.css",
      Another possible way of refactoring, knowing we have a collection of items, i.e. an array
      ```javascript 
      Array.from(elements).forEach(element => {});
      ```

## Google Maps API
### General API definition
  - Definition
      - the acronym API stands for application programming interface
  - What it does ?
    - helps developers to create complex functionality more. These help abstract more complex code away from you
#### Incorporating Google Maps to web pages
  - After declaring the HTML file as <!DOCTYPE html>
  - Create ~~~~<div>~~~~to hold the google map
  - Write a JS function that creates a map in the previously created <div> element
  - Load the Maps JS API using a script tag

    - Loading the map
 ```javascript 
    <script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap">
</script>
```
    - the url inside the script tag above, is where the javascript file that loads everything within the map using the Maps Javascript API.
    - the async attribute aids the browser to load the rest of website while the map also loads. 
    - if the attributes `async` & `defer` are, leads to stopping the loading of the API, until it finishes downloading. This will eventually slowdown your page load.
### Google map library
- Bootstrap [URL](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js) links such as these are linked inside the HTML for the page
- This request then loads all of the main JS objects and symbols to be usedin the Maps Javascript API
- Breaking up supplmental components into libraries allow for a quicker and parsing, hence loading.

## Lessons from setting up scss files
### A few reasons why styling on scss wouldn't show on page
  - over indentation of CSS property value codes 
  - incorrect path for / missing (from sass compiled) generated css output
  - as for the background-image
  - shorthand background-image: (url) *no-repeat* *cover*; could prevent background images from showing
    - preferably write the extended format
### Using flexbox
  - Visualise boxes all over in the page
  - Distinguish between parent(container / wrapper) and child items 
  - Parent(container / wrapper) where you should apply the `display: flex;` and the immediate descendant/child items
  - Should it be needed, apply flexbox model within the child items themselves (carry on to imagine parent-child item relationship) 
  - Then adjust, among other `property: value;` pairs, manipulating with `justify-content: flex-start flex space-around, space-between` as well `margin: ` & `padding`
